1. Using the variables provided, your knowledge of the print() function, and the proper logical operators, write code to help you check Cher and Dionne’s outﬁts! Here are some variables that describe each girl’s outﬁt:

cher_dress_color='pink' 
cher_shoe_color	='white', 
cher_has_earrings=True, 
dionne_dress_color='purple',
dionne_shoe_color='pink', 
dionne_has_earrings=True, 

For each outﬁt check, ﬁrst determine which variables to use that best match the scenario. Then, write some code to compare the variables you have chosen with the proper logical operator. Finally , use the print() function to print a sentence stating the outﬁt check and use your comparison code as a True or False answer. 

1. Change your existing print() function to use an f-string. Create two variables: one called name and one called age. Assign a string with your name to the name variable. Assign a math operation (that equals your age) to the age variable. For example: age=20+7 Finally , print out your new introduction to the computer using your f-string and name and age variables!

1. Create a variable called magic_number. Then, assign to it a special calculation that equals 333. The calculation must follow these rules: You must use the ** operator at least once. You must use the % operator at least once. Once you’ve assigned your magic_number variable to your calculation, use the print() function to make sure it equals 333!
