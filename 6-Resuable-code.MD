1. What will be the output?
   ```python
   def greet(name, is_new):
    if(is_new):
        print(f"Hello,{name} !! Nice to meet you!")
    else:
        print(f"What's up, {name}?? Nice to meet you again!!")
        
        greet("Nitesh", True)
   ```

1. Create a function called **superpower()**. Have your **superpower()** function accept two parameters: one called name and another called power. Using these parameters, have yourfunction print out an f-string that says who you are and waht your superpower is !

1. Create a function called funny_greeting(). Have your funny_greeting() function accept two parameters: one called color and another called dessert/ Using these parameters, have your function print out an f-string that mixes up the parameters on purpose to produce a silly message!

1. Write a function called **factorial()** that takes one parameter. This parameter will be a number. Then, write the code to calculate the factorial of the number that is passed in as a parameter. Have your factorial() function returned the answer??

1. Write a function called dessert_sorter() that takes one parameter. Call the parameter total_desserts. Then, write some code that will help Dolores and Maeve separate the cupcakes from the cookies. This should be a for loop that goes through the total_desserts and checks for these things: •If it’s a number that’s divisible by 3, print out the word “cupcake.” •If it’s a number that’s divisible by 5, print out the word “cookie.” •If it’s a number that’s divisible by both 3 and 5, print out “it’s a cupcakecookie!” When you’re done creating your dessert_sorter() function, pass in 200 as the total_desserts parameter, because that’s how many boxes Dolores and Maeve have to sort!

1. Create a file called rock-paper-scissors-game, and save it. Next, begin creating your game! Let’s start by greeting the players: print("Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors Game!") Their should be two players make variable name as player_1 and player_2 define a compare function and have it accept two parameters and continue your task.

1. Create a new file called hangman and save it. start writing the code into your own hangman.py file.
