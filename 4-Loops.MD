1. What will be the output?
   ```python
   numbers = [1,2,3,4,4,6,7,8,9]
   for number in numbers: 
   print(number + 2)
   ```

1. Write a loop that outputs the name of the person and their favourite dessert using two lists below. The order of favourite              desserts matches the order of the people who like them, so don't worry about that. Use an f-string to print out the message.

1. Create a list with the animal leg information, use a loop to iterate through them all, and keep count of which group we add              each animal to. Print out the total number of animals in each groups.
   moose = 4,
   snake = 0,
   penguin = 2,
   lion = 4,
   monkey = 2,
   dolphin = 0,
   bear = 2,
   elephant = 4, 
   giraffe = 4,
   koala = 2,
   shark =  0,
   kangaroo = 2,
   komodo _ dragon = 4
   
1. Create a new python file called secret-message, and save it. In your program, create three variables: one for a password, one            for a user's guess, and another for your secret message.

1. Create a new python file called guess-the-number-game, and save it. In your program, import the random module by typing *import    random* and create two variables: one to store the number the computer randomly picks, and one for the number of guesses you      will allow in your game
